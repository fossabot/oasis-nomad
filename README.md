# Oasis Nomad Manager
A Nomad management CLI for single-node and small cluster use cases

# What

Oasis provides a set of commands to easily manage a single-node Nomad server,
run tasks and keep them up to date.
Its design is opinionated and tailored to the single-node, self-hosted use case, with
the goal of reducing operational toil while keeping the tasks secure and up-to-date.

# Why Nomad

While containers' immutability is great for self-hosted servers where things might
quickly become dangerously tangled, the docker API and docker-compose and notoriously
hard to program with. Nomad provides a sane API in a small footprint. Associated with
Consul for configuration and service discovery, it provides all the features needed.
